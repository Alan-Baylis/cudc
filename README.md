# Overview
This is a CUDA implementation of Dual Contouring.
It is for the final project
of CS 217(GPU Architecture and Programming),
University of California, Riverside in Fall 2015.

In December 2015 I make this project public.
And it will be graded.

I will continue to work on this project to
fix the numerical stability issues,
implement the 3D version,
and implement the adaptive dual contouring.
